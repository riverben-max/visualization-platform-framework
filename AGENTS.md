# Project Agent Instructions

- This project is a Vue 3 + JavaScript front-end visualization platform based on Ruoyi low-code.
- Backend project path: D:\enrionment\框架\后端服务
- Prefer `rg` for searching, and keep diffs minimal.
- Use `src/` as the primary source tree; avoid touching `node_modules/`.
- Ask before running commands that install packages or modify the lockfile.
- All Vue components must use `scoped` styles and follow the existing data-v based component structure.
- For UI changes, keep layout consistent with existing views under `src/views/`.
